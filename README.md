# 11ty QR Code Shortner
By the powers of [1y](https://github.com/nhoizey/1y) and [findth.at](https://github.com/philhawksworth/findthat.at), I give you Frankenstein's Monster. The goal of this project was two fold, first to see if I could combine two of my favorite open source projects into one and second to make a useful linkshortner and QR code generator for myself an dmy colleagues to use.
